# Alteryx Workflows 👩‍💻

- We have used Alteryx for calculating R Score, F Score, and M Score For RFM Analysis and Segmentation of customers. 
- Alteryx is used to automate data processes more quickly and efficiently. It collects, prepares, and blends data that may otherwise be time-consuming or impossible to combine using other tools. 
- Through this, Alteryx provides answers to complex business questions and can help to simplify or automate data processes. 
- This not only saves a significant amount of time, but also helps to prevent errors that may have occurred if the process were done manually.

- “R” stands for Recency and refers to how recently a customer has bought. 
- Customer with most recent order are given R_SCORE AS 4

- “F" stands for Frequency and refers to How often do they purchase?
- Customer with most frequent orders are given F_SCORE AS 4
- Formula used - 𝑰𝑭 [𝑺𝒖𝒎 𝒐𝒇 𝑸𝒖𝒂𝒏𝒕𝒊𝒕𝒚] = 𝟓𝟕 𝒐𝒓 [𝑺𝒖𝒎 𝒐𝒇 𝑸𝒖𝒂𝒏𝒕𝒊𝒕𝒚] > 𝟑𝟓 𝑻𝑯𝑬𝑵 𝟒 𝑬𝑳𝑺𝑬𝑰𝑭 [𝑺𝒖𝒎 𝒐𝒇 𝑸𝒖𝒂𝒏𝒕𝒊𝒕𝒚]>= 𝟑𝟓 𝒐𝒓 [𝑺𝒖𝒎 𝒐𝒇 𝑸𝒖𝒂𝒏𝒕𝒊𝒕𝒚] > 𝟏𝟓 𝑻𝑯𝑬𝑵 𝟑

- "M" stands for Monetary Value and refers to how much do they spend?
- Customer with Max SUM_PROFIT are given M_SCORE AS 4
- Formula Used - 𝑰𝑭 [𝑺𝒖𝒎 𝒐𝒇 𝑷𝒓𝒐𝒇𝒊𝒕] = 𝟏𝟗𝟕𝟎 𝒐𝒓 [𝑺𝒖𝒎 𝒐𝒇 𝑷𝒓𝒐𝒇𝒊𝒕] > 𝟓𝟎𝟎 𝑻𝑯𝑬𝑵 𝟒 𝑬𝑳𝑺𝑬𝑰𝑭 [𝑺𝒖𝒎 𝒐𝒇 𝑷𝒓𝒐𝒇𝒊𝒕] >= 𝟓𝟎𝟎 𝒐𝒓 [𝑺𝒖𝒎 𝒐𝒇 𝑷𝒓𝒐𝒇𝒊𝒕] > 𝟐𝟐 𝑻𝑯𝑬𝑵 𝟑

- Combined RFM Score can be calculated using this formula - ([𝑹_𝑺𝒄𝒐𝒓𝒆] * 𝟏𝟎𝟎) + ([𝑭_𝑺𝒄𝒐𝒓𝒆] * 𝟏𝟎) + [𝑴_𝑺𝒄𝒐𝒓𝒆] 
- Based on the RFM Scores Customers are divided into various segments such as Platimum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze.
