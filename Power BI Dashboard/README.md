► RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a marketing technique used to segment customers based on their purchase behavior. <br>
► It involves analyzing the recency (how recently a customer made a purchase), frequency (how often a customer makes a purchase), and monetary value (how much a customer spends) of their transactions. <br>
► The RFM model assigns a score to each customer in each category (1-5) and then combines the scores to create a composite RFM score. <br>
► Customers are then segmented based on their composite RFM score, with the highest scoring customers considered the most valuable. <br>
